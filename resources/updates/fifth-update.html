<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Hello again friends of Sol!</h3>
<br />
<br />
With the new year, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174837/sol-last-days-star" target="_blank"><b>Sol: Last Days of a Star</b></a> is approaching a culmination of sorts. So many things are happening at once, all converging to make Sol a reality. A real board game, being played by people all over the world!
<br />
<br />
First and foremost, the Kickstarter is imminent!
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Kickstarter Launch Date: February 2nd!</h3>
<br />
<b>Sol: Last Days of a Star</b> goes live on Kickstarter in two weeks, February 2nd, 2016! We would love to have you be part of the campaign, and help us make this project - which has been so much a part of our lives the past two years - a reality! First day backers can make a huge difference in establishing momentum and success on Kickstarter, so if you're planning to back us, consider backing us on Day 1!
<br />
<br />
We will send out one more update that day to let everyone know we are live, and you can follow our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElephantLabsGames" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/elephantnahpele" target="_blank">Twitter</a> page to keep abreast of developments as they arise.

<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Sol Kickstarter Animation: a Teaser</h3>
<br />
Some of our dear friends with amazing art and video talents have put together an animation to open our Kickstarter video. It is a stunning piece of work, and really sets the tone for the universe of the game. Since you are all of our earliest supporters, we have decided to share it with you now... enjoy! And let us know what you think.

<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Pieces becoming a work of art</h3>
<br />
We have engaged the amazing and visionary Jon Mietling of <a href="http://portaldragon.com/" target="_blank">Portal Dragon</a> as the official sculptor for the pieces for <b>Sol: Last Days of a Star</b>. We met Jon at GenCon last year and loved his work for their upcoming Kickstarter <a href="http://www.zephyrboardgame.com/" target="_blank">Zephyr: Winds of Change</a>. Here is a preview of the next level he is taking the pieces to:

<br />
<br />
We feel these designs capture the spirit of the game in a beautiful way. For the base game these will be the pieces for all five worlds and colors, with a stretch goal of having unique pieces for each different world. Really excited about these, thanks Jon!
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">What's new? Quick Start Rules!</h3>
<br />
Based on user feedback and playtesting, we have added a setup variant for Quick Start! This compresses play time while providing an interesting strategic placement decision right away. This is a great way to introduce the game to people and prepare them for a strategic opening in future games.
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Upcoming Reviews</h3>
<br />
We have several review copies out right now, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/UndeadVikingVideos/featured" target="_blank">Undead Viking</a>, <a href="http://www.boardtodeath.tv/" target="_blank">Board to Death</a>, <a href="http://geekdad.com/2015/03/meet-jonathan-liu/" target="_blank">Geekdad Jonathan Liu</a> and a couple others!
