Hello Friends of SOL!<br />
<br />
Many things have happened, are happening and are yet to happen in the world of <a href="http://elephantlaboratories.com/sol/game" target="_blank">Sol: Last Days of a Star</a>. Some of them involve you! Here is a short summary:
<br /><br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Upcoming Demo Days</h3><br />
We have a number of demo days coming up in Portland and surrounding areas if you want to see how the game is evolving. Here is a selection, and feel free to suggest more! We are happy to meet most evenings and weekends if you and/or your group want to play.<br />
<br />
<b>Thursday 6/11, 6:00</b> at <a href="http://rainy-day-games.com/" target="_blank">Rainy Day Games</a> in Beaverton, OR (their Fresh Games event)<br />
<b>Friday 6/12, 8:00</b> at <a href="http://www.diceagegames.com/" target="_blank">Dice Age Games</a> in Vancouver, WA<br />

<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Kickstarter</h3><br />
Preparations for Kickstarter are accelerating as we speak. We have been doing a ton of research and work to make sure we launch this on a solid foundation. Can&#39;t wait for the madness and chaos everyone assures me this process is! We will keep you posted as details emerge.<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">BoardGameGeek</h3><br />
Sol is on BGG... and we just got our <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1378257/demo-session-kublacon-2015" target="_blank">first review</a> (thanks Steve)! Feel free to ask questions or post things on the BGG page, I will be watching it closely.<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Chronicle and Twitter</h3><br />
We&#39;ve even started a <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1378257/demo-session-kublacon-2015" target="_blank">chronicle</a> (because I hate the word bl*g...)  and a <a href="https://twitter.com/elephantnahpele" target="_blank">twitter account</a> (???) Seriously! I have three followers (of which Jodi is one). I might even say things there! We&#39;ll see.<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Art and Design</h3><br />
We have been working closely with the amazing and talented Mark Duszkiewicz and his team over and <a href="http://www.armsandanchors.com/" target="_blank">Arms and Anchors</a> to give Sol its (visual) voice. The work they have done so far is smouldering and visceral, it really conveys the spirit that has been latent in the project all along. I can&#39;t wait to see this evolve and finally share it with all of you!<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">KublaCon!</h3>
<br />
KublaCon (San Francisco, CA) was amazing! This is where we met many of you. Besides the wonderful people, festive atmosphere, trees living inside and legitimate presence of sunbeams, we also took part in the game design contest and were honored to win 2nd place! As we speak there is a silver statue of Kubla Khan smiling benevolently upon the small (medium) pile of games I haven&#39;t yet found shelving for. <br />

<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">PDXAGE</h3>
<br />
This was a small but potent convention in Portland, OR where we hung out with fellow game designers from <a href="http://weirdcitygames.com/" target="_blank">Weird City Games</a> (of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156496/march-ants" target="_blank">March of the Ants</a>) and <a href="http://gamesicledesign.com/" target="_blank">Gamesicle</a> (the guys behind <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1283899359/bane-tabletop-card-game" target="_blank">Bane</a>, currently on Kickstarter!) Great to see everyone! Looking forward to seeing this convention evolve.<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">GameStorm</h3><br />
Way back in March the whole crew hit up GameStorm in Vancouver, WA, which was an exceptional event. GameStorm has a dear place in our hearts because it was the first convention we brought Sol to the year before and the first game convention any of us had been to. This year: so many Sol demos, so many great connections. Also, a serious game of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/95527/madeira" target="_blank">Madeira</a> happened. Thanks to everyone!<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Future Conventions</h3><br />
We are planning on hitting up GenCon, DragonFlight and BGGCon in the coming months. If you are going to be there find us and say hi!<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Thank you!</h3><br />
Thanks again for all the support and excitement you have all shown for our labor of love called Sol. It is pretty amazing to see people react to something that has been incubating in our workshop for so long. We&#39;ll be in touch again with the latest news, demo days and countdown to Kickstarter.<br />
