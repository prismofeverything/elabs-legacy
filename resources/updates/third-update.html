<br />
Ryan and Jodi recently demoed <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174837/sol-last-days-star" target="_blank">Sol</a> with some of the great folks at <a href="http://www.xplane.com/" target="_blank">XPLANE</a>! Afterwards XPLANE interviewed Ryan about his thoughts on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174837/sol-last-days-star" target="_blank">Sol</a> and game design in general. <a href="http://xblog.xplane.com/game-design-unreserved-creativity-and-the-end-of-the-sun--an-interview-with-ryan-spangler/" target="_blank">Check it out here!</a>

<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Sol on Geekline!</h3>
<br />
We met the rowdy guys over at <a href="http://www.geekline415.com/" target="_blank">Geekline</a> at KublaCon in May, and they have invited us to be on their show! We are planning on Tuesday, September 1st at 8pm, so tune in to hear us rap with the geekline crew. Should be raucous and fun, and potentially poignant and enlightening? Live radio, anything can happen!

<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Sol at GenCon</h3>
<br />
We recently took <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174837/sol-last-days-star" target="_blank">Sol</a> out East to GenCon... and Whoa. What an amazing experience. Great to meet everyone out there! Check out the latest <a href="http://elephantlaboratories.com/chronicle/posts/2015-08-04-gencon.html" target="_blank">Chronicle</a> for Ryan's narrative on our maiden voyage to the Con to end all Cons, and find some pictures <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElephantLabsGames/photos_stream" target="_blank">here!</a>

<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Elephant Labs on Facebook</h3>
<br />
Did I say <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElephantLabsGames" target="_blank">Facebook?</a> It is true, Jodi finally broke down and started a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElephantLabsGames" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> for <a href="http://elephantlaboratories.com" target="_blank">Elephant Laboratories</a>. And actually, it is kind of cool! If you do things like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElephantLabsGames" target="_blank">Facebook</a> you may be into this. Jodi is also on <a href="https://twitter.com/sweetmanpdx" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for an entirely different take on things.

<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Sol at Dragonflight</h3>
<br />
Sean and Ryan also stopped by <a href="http://www.dragonflight.org/" target="_blank">Dragonflight</a> last weekend in Bellevue, Washington. It was our second <a href="http://www.dragonflight.org/" target="_blank">Dragonflight</a> and we saw a bunch of familiar faces and met some new ones. New faces. Meeting faces. Great to see everyone! Thanks for all the feedback on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174837/sol-last-days-star" target="_blank">Sol</a> and our new prototype... still currently top secret.
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">BGGCon</h3>
<br />
We are also planning on storming <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/forum/52/boardgamegeek/bggcon" target="_blank">BGGCon</a> in November in Dallas. Let us know if you will be there! Looking forward to meeting BGG in person.
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Thank you!</h3>
<br />
Once again, it is amazing to meet everyone and discover the hidden depths of the tabletop and game design community (and beyond!). We couldn't do it without you, and we can't wait to deliver on this project that has inspired us for so long.

With Momentum,
