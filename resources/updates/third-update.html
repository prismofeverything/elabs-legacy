<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Hello friends of Sol!</h3>
<br />
<br />

We just got a cord of firewood & it's time to fan the flames of Sol and ride this fireball into Kickstarter!! 

Here are the latest developments on Sol: Last Days of a Star.
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Art Revolution</h3>
<br />
One of the most exciting things in recent weeks has been a complete renovation of the art for Sol by our dear friend over at <a href="http://www.armsandanchors.com/" target="_blank">Arms and Anchors</a>, Mr. Mark Dusckiewicz.  Without further ado, here is the latest logo for the game:
<br />
<br />
I feel like this really captures the dark and smouldering spirit of the game in a dazzling manner.  Our greatest thanks to you Mark for the inspiration and majesty you bring to the game!
<br />
All of the components (gameboard, instability track, cards, player aids and more) are likewise enhanced, which you can find on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElephantLabsGames" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> and also <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174837/sol-last-days-star" target="_blank">Boardgamegeek</a>.  Let me know what you think!
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Kickstarter!</h3>
<br />
Yep. Still tracking for January!!  Next steps include working out the kickstarter page, shooting the video (with timelapse gameplay!) and getting our new <a href="http://elephantlaboratories.com/sol-rulebook.pdf" target="_blank">Rulebook</a> and prototypes out to reviewers!  Exciting times.
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Upcoming Demos</h3>
<br />
We don't currently have any dates set. If you're in Oregon or Washington, let us know if you'd like to set one up! 
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Shameless Favor Asking: Review us on BGG</h3>
<br />
If you have a BGG account and you've played/enjoyed Sol: Last Days of a Star, please help us out by rating and reviewing it over on our page!  We'd love to hear what you think about it.

<br />
We played a LOT of games this past weekend up at Sasquatch (Essen-focused game bonanza) and many more have hit the table in the weeks prior.

Developing Faction Stories and New Pieces
Based on a lot of feedback from you fine people, Ryan & Sean are working to further develop the identities and stories of each faction. Look for more updates on the stories and the art to come soon!

Happy Wednesday!

<br />
We met the rowdy guys over at <a href="http://www.geekline415.com/" target="_blank">Geekline</a> at KublaCon in May, and they have invited us to be on their show! We are planning on Tuesday, September 1st at 8pm, so tune in to hear us rap with the geekline crew. Should be raucous and fun, and potentially poignant and enlightening? Live radio, anything can happen!
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Sol at GenCon</h3>
<br />
We recently took <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174837/sol-last-days-star" target="_blank">Sol</a> out East to GenCon... and Whoa. What an amazing experience. Great to meet everyone out there!

<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Elephant Labs on Facebook</h3>
<br />
Did I say <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElephantLabsGames" target="_blank">Facebook?</a> It is true, Jodi finally broke down and started a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElephantLabsGames" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> for <a href="http://elephantlaboratories.com" target="_blank">Elephant Laboratories</a>. And actually, it is kind of cool! If you do things like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElephantLabsGames" target="_blank">Facebook</a> you may be into this. Jodi is also on <a href="https://twitter.com/sweetmanpdx" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for an entirely different take on things.
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Sol at Dragonflight</h3>
<br />
Sean and Ryan also stopped by <a href="http://www.dragonflight.org/" target="_blank">Dragonflight</a> last weekend in Bellevue, Washington. It was our second <a href="http://www.dragonflight.org/" target="_blank">Dragonflight</a> and we saw a bunch of familiar faces and met some new ones. New faces. Meeting faces. Great to see everyone! Thanks for all the feedback on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174837/sol-last-days-star" target="_blank">Sol</a> and our new prototype... still currently top secret.
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">BGGCon</h3>
<br />
We are also planning on storming <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/forum/52/boardgamegeek/bggcon" target="_blank">BGGCon</a> in November in Dallas. Let us know if you will be there! Looking forward to meeting BGG in person.
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Thank you!</h3>
<br />
Once again, it is amazing to meet everyone and discover the hidden depths of the tabletop and game design community (and beyond!). We couldn't do it without you, and we can't wait to deliver on this project that has inspired us for so long.
<br />
<br />
With Momentum,
