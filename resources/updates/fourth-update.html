<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Hello friends of Sol!</h3>
<br />
<br />
As the weather gets colder the Sun blazes ever brighter in Sol: Last Days of a Star! Every day brings us closer to the supernova.
<br />
<br />
Here are the latest developments in the world of Sol:
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Art Revolution</h3>
<br />
One of the most exciting things in recent weeks has been a complete renovation of the art for Sol by our dear friend over at <a href="http://www.armsandanchors.com/" target="_blank">Arms and Anchors</a>, Mr. Mark Dusckiewicz. He's really captured the dark and smouldering spirit of <a href="http://elephantlaboratories.com/sol/game" target="_blank"/>Sol</a> in a dazzling manner. Our greatest thanks to you Mark for the inspiration and majesty you bring to the game!
<br />
<br />
You can find previews of all on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElephantLabsGames" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> and also <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174837/sol-last-days-star" target="_blank">Boardgamegeek</a>. Let us know what you think!
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Kickstarter!</h3>
<br />
Yep. Still tracking for January! Next steps include working out the Kickstarter page, shooting the video (with timelapse gameplay!) and getting our new <a href="http://elephantlaboratories.com/sol-rulebook.pdf" target="_blank">rulebook</a> and prototypes out to reviewers! Exciting times.
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Upcoming Demos</h3>
<br />
We don't currently have any dates set. If you're in Oregon or Washington, let us know if you'd like to set one up!

We played a LOT of games this past weekend up at Sasquatch (Essen-focused game bonanza) and many more have hit the table in the weeks prior.

<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Developing Faction Stories and New Pieces</h3>
<br />
Based on a lot of feedback from you fine people, Ryan & Sean are developing the identities and mythos of each faction with the help from some amazing digital painting from Mark. Look for more updates on the stories and the art to come soon!
<br />
