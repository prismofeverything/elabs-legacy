Hello!

This is Ryan, one of the designers of Sol: Last Days of a Star. First off, thank you for your generous contribution! As one of four people at this level, you are a significant backer. It means a lot that you felt inspired to help us out in this way. Looking forward to working with you on naming one of the five worlds!

I wanted to reach out and start the process of finding a name. We are planning on delivering final files at the end of August, so we have a little time, but not much!

First question is, which world? We have five worlds, one for each player, and each has a color associated to it. In order from closest to the Sun to furthest they are: White, Green, Blue, Purple and Black. Each has a character and a personality associated with it
