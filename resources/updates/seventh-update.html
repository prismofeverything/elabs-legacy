<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Hello again friends of Sol!</h3>
<br />
We have missed you! Every day brings us closer to making <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174837/sol-last-days-star" target="_blank">Sol: Last Days of a Star</a> a reality, and we are excited to finally get the last pieces in place for our campaign... (drumroll) 
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Kickstarter: May 3rd!</h3>
<br />
Yes! May is the time. I saw a flower today, so it must be true. Manufacturing, freight and shipping are now solid, and everything is in place for launch. Leading up to this historic event, you can keep abreast of the latest news on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElephantLabsGames" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/elephantnahpele" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and of course always feel free to reach out. We love hearing from you.
<br />
<br />
Can't wait to see you on Kickstarter!

<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">New Board made of Fire!</h3>
<br />
Ever since we originally conceived of the game, we imagined the board as the Sun. From the very beginning this guiding principle, that we are playing a game on the Sun, has driven every decision we've made. 
<br />
<br />
Now, that vision is a reality. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/EIZGrSp.jpg" target="_blank">Finally, a board that is actually on fire!</a> (Actual prototype). You cannot get closer to the Sun unless you literally trigger a fusion reaction on the table. 
<br />
<br />
Also, check out those sweet pieces. Thanks <a href="http://portaldragon.com/" target="_blank">Portal Dragon!</a>
<br />
<br />
[Jodi disclaimer: the board is not actually fire. No solar systems were hurt in the making of this game board.]

<br />
Ryan has started a new blog on BGG to share his musings on game design and philosophy. <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/blog/5404" target="_blank">Check it out here!</a> Thoughts and discussion welcome.

<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Demos! and Sol on Tabletop Simulator</h3>
<br />
Anyone in the Portland or Seattle area want to do a demo? Just let us know! We have given a host of great demos recently, all up and down the west coast. You could be next.
<br />
<br />
Also, we just got Sol set up on <a href="http://berserk-games.com/tabletop-simulator/" target="_blank">Tabletop Simulator</a>, so if you have it we can play no matter where in the world you are! Just ask and we'll schedule a virtual game.
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Gamestorm!</h3>
<br />
This weekend in Vancouver, Washington is <a href="http://www.gamestorm.org/" target="_blank">Gamestorm!</a> The first board game convention we ever brought Sol to (two years ago now! Thank you GameLab). Let us know if you will be there! And if you want to schedule a demo of Sol either tell us (reply to this email) or you can find us by our signature red explosion shirts. 
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">KublaCon!</h3>
<br />
We will be finishing up our campaign at <a href="http://www.kublacon.com/">KublaCon</a> at the end of May! We met many of you there last year and were honored by the Silver Kubla for Sol in the game design contest. Can't wait to see you all again! 
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Thank you!</h3>
<br />
As always, our deepest gratitude for your enthusiasm and support! You are the reason we are doing this.
