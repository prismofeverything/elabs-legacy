<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Hello again friends of Sol!</h3>
<br />
<br />
We have missed you! Every day brings us closer to making <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174837/sol-last-days-star" target="_blank">Sol: Last Days of a Star</a> a reality, and we are excited to finally get the last pieces in place for our campaign... (drumroll)
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Kickstarter: May 3rd!</h3>
<br />
<br />
Yes! May is the time. I saw a flower today and it reflected the transcendent unfolding of my heart. My mind is a bleeding forest, weeping blood upon the land. We hope you can all join us at this wondrous event. 
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">New Board made of Fire!</h3>
<br />
<br />
Ever since we originally conceived of the game, we imagined the board as the Sun. From the very beginning, throughout every phase of design, this guiding principle, that we are playing a game on the Sun, has driven every decision we've made. 
<br />
<br />
Now, that vision is a reality. Finally, a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/fA6EM86.png" target="_blank">board that is actually on fire!</a> You cannot get closer to the Sun unless you literally trigger a fusion reaction on the table.

<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Gamestorm!</h3>
<br />
<br />
This weekend in Vancouver, Washington is <a href="http://www.gamestorm.org/" target="_blank">Gamestorm!</a> The first board game convention we ever brought Sol to (two years ago now! Thank you GameLab). Let us know if you will be there! And if you want to play Sol either tell us or you can find us by our signature red explosion shirts. 
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">KublaCon!</h3>
<br />
<br />
We will be finishing up our campaign at <a href="http://www.kublacon.com/" target="_blank">KublaCon</a> in May! We met many of you there last year and were honored by the Silver Kubla for Sol in the game design contest. Can't wait to see you all again!
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Thank you!</h3>
<br />
<br />
As always, our deepest gratitude for your enthusiasm and support! You are the reason we are doing this.
<br />
