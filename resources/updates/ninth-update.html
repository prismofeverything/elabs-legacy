And just like that, we are launched: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elephantlaboratories/sol-last-days-of-a-star" target="_blank">Sol: Last Days of a Star on Kickstarter!</a>
<br />
<br />
So much effort and preparation, now to watch our tiny pod of humanity drift serenely into open space.
<br />
<br />
The most successful campaigns begin with big momentum on the first day, so we're hoping you can help make a huge impact right out of the gate!
<br />
<br />
We're so grateful for all your support in getting us here. It has been an amazing journey to get to this point. Now is the moment of truth, and we need your help. Please follow the link above and back our project. Then, share the link with everyone you know!
<br />
<br />
Together we can make this happen. To the future!

<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Mass Thumbing</h3>
<br />
To help gain early momentum, we want to make the Hotness list on BGG. If you are not familiar with this, trust us: it matters. If you are familiar: cool!
<br />
<br />
All you have to do is follow this link and <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2656553/sol-last-days-star" target="_blank">thumb this image</a>. We will all thumb as one, and sear the Hotness with the heat of a thousand blinding Suns. We will BE the Hotness!
<br />
<br />
Let the mass thumbing commence!
