<h3 style="line-height: 21px;">Hello Friends!</h3>
<br />
<br />
Yes, it's true, we are postponing our Kickstarter launch. Per the gospel of Jamey <a href="http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter-lesson-68-you-dont-have-to-launch-today/" target="_blank">"You don't have to launch today"</a> Stegmaier, there are just a couple more things we want to get super dialed-in prior to launching. But it won't be a long delay! Read on!
<br />
<br />
As you know, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174837/sol-last-days-star" target="_blank">Sol</a> is the culmination of a life-long dream, a tremendous amount of hard work, and remarkable community support. We are anxious to launch, but more importantly we want to give Sol the very best shot at funding & that means just a bit more care and attention to detail before releasing her into the world of crowd funding. 
<br />
<br />
The good news: our additional diligence means greater likelihood of funding so YOU are more likely to see the final version of <b>Sol: Last Days of a Star</b> on your own game table at home!
<br />
<br />
Other good news: Are you the kid who opened Christmas gifts early? Our Kickstarter page is ~98% complete, barring some editing and updating of numbers (see below). If you'd like a sneak peek, reply to this email & let us know. We'll share out on a "hell yes I'm interested" basis only : ) 
<br />
<br />
MORE good news: Undead Viking sent us his review and it is awesome! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHkFxrBmzLc" target="_blank">Check it out here.</a> It's lengthy, so if you only want his commentary, you can skip the gameplay walkthrough in the middle...but we think it's a wonderful watch all the way through : ) 
<br />
<br />
But we know you have questions, so here are some answers for you:
<br />
<br />
<b>1. Why, guys? WHY?</b>
<br />
<br />
We have read & heard countless times: make sure your estimating is bullet-proof...for production, stretch goals, freight AND shipping.  
We've worked hard to do this, but we've received some late-breaking competitive estimates that we want to investigate thoroughly to validate we're getting the best value, highest quality and most reliable service across the board. 
<br />
<br />
We also feel strongly that we can't possibly over-prepare, so while we're working on buttoning-up numbers, we're also taking the extra time to further hone our full campaign plan (updates, social presence, etc) as well as continuing work on designing our new components and adding even more flare (ahem) to our game board.
<br />
<br />
<b>2. So when ARE you launching?</b>
<br />
<br />
Great question. We aren't going to pinpoint a date until we nail down that critical data we just mentioned, but we are committed to launching within the next 4-7 weeks. We will send another pre-launch announcement as we narrow-in on a new date.
<br />
<br />
<b>3. What if I just can't wait anymore?</b>
<br />
<br />
We know it's difficult...it's hard for us too. We're also working to get Sol up on <a href="http://berserk-games.com/tabletop-simulator/" target="_blank">Tabletop Simulator</a> so very soon you will be able to play <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174837/sol-last-days-star" target="_blank">Sol</a> with people all over the world!
<br />
<br />
<b>4. I have other questions!</b>
<br />
<br />
Thanks for showing so much interest! We are more than happy to correspond with you 1:1 to discuss more details around our decision. Simply reply to this email and we will get back to you within 24 hours. 
<br />
<br />
Thank you for your support, understanding, and patience!
<br />
