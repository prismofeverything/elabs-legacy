I spent years playing only [Go][go], and I still consider it the greatest game ever devised by humankind.  (In fact, of [all the games in my collection][prismofeverything] it is my only '10').  It has the simplest ruleset of any game I can think of, and its depth is boundless.  And, it has blatantly no theme.  Even [Chess][chess], the other king of abstracts, has more theme (Kings!  Queens!  Knights!  Bishops!  Pawns....).  And even [Go][go] has [Life and Death][lifeanddeath].  It seems even in the most themeless of games, some relationship to existence is unavoidable.
