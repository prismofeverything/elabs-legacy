### The first braying call of the Elephant

Every animal at some point makes its first noise, its first announcement of existence.  I personally have made many since, but I don't remember my first.  Was it triumph?  Pain?  Bewilderment?  Joy?  Or maybe just the involuntary expression of a creature with newly found vocal cords.  

In any case, this is the first call of Elephant Laboratories.  It may be considered similarly without specific content or meaning, but more a fundamental expression of existence.  Many years from now, like my own first emission, I will probably have no memory of this.  But for now, this is all I have.  This is my sentiment.  We exist.
