      <p><h2 class="purple">We should have known.</h2></p><br />

      <p class="white">But our prosperity and comfort made us believe we could do anything.  We had already accomplished everything we had dreamed.  Actually, I think in some dark hidden part of ourselves we did know.  We also knew, in the same unspoken way, that only the sun itself could allow us to continue the life to which we had grown accustomed.</p><br />
      <p class="white">Our historians tell us that the people of the Four Worlds are descended from a race of savage people many suns away.  From what little we have been able to piece together, this ancient world was a lonely one.  The only life bearing world in the solar system, it's inhabitants were unsure if life existed or was even possible anywhere else.  The legends state that through carelessness and a warlike nature our progenitors spoiled their world and in desperation set out to the stars towards the Four Worlds, hoping for salvation.  We are the result of that desperate hope.  It is ironic to me that now we, who thought ourselves so much more enlightened, are facing the same situation.  Instead of spoiling our world we have done so much worse, we have spoiled the very source of all life, our sun.</p><br />
      <p class="white">We are a peaceful people.  We have built civilizations of unprecedented longevity, stability and comfort by abandoning the savagery of our ancestors.  In this warm atmosphere of peace and plenty, technology and mental cultivation have flourished.  No longer have we wasted precious energy on wars and conflicts.  Reason and intelligence have ruled our society.</p><br />
      <h3 class="purple">That is what makes this re-emergence of savagery so shocking.  </h3><br />
      <p class="white">When the news came that the sun had been destabilized beyond any point of return by our harvesting technology, the leaders of the Four Worlds all realized we could not stay.  We had shared our technology freely with one another.  We had all discussed, as a theory, the idea of the Great Ark.  A ship that could support the lives of many millions of people for the generations of travel necessary to bring our organic forms safely through the vast reaches of space to another sun, another world.</p><br />
      <h3 class="purple">But why would we ever really need to build such a thing?  We had everything we needed here.</h3><br />
      <p class="white">Suddenly, with the sun dying, it became the only way we could survive.  We were shaken out of our complacency.  It was only reasonable that only some could board the ark and become the seeds of a new world.  There was not room for everyone.  Somehow, people began to lose their reason.  Everyone wanted themselves and their families on the ark.  Weapons of death, a relic of our antiquated past re-emerged.  People suddenly found strange ancient religions that proclaimed them the chosen ones.  Chaos and bloodshed became common.  The leadership was shocked, but not too much so.  We were leaders for a reason.  We struck quickly and decisively.  Unfortunately, I now have the blood of many on my hands.  There was no choice.  To devolve into further chaos would have been the end of everyone.  Of course, the only way to convince the killing squads to cooperate was to promise them a place on the ark.  This bothered my conscience.  Did I want violence to be a strong trait in the new civilization?  No, of course not, there must only be peaceful cooperation.  The killing squads were herded onto ships that they believed were going to the ark, then humanely put down with odorless poison.</p><br />
      <p class="white">The stage is set, the ark is ready to launch.  There only remains one last task.  To push the ark from this solar system with enough momentum to escape the coming supernova.  Unfortunately, the only way to do this is to harvest massive quantities of energy from the sun, further weakening it's stability and sending it to supernova even faster.</p><br />
      <p class="white">I realize that to harvest this much energy may leave the other three worlds without enough time to harvest the energy needed to power their own arks.  There is nothing to be done.  I wish them the best, but I must care for my people.</p><br />
      <p><h2 class="green">With a heavy heart I send our workers into the very heart of the sun.</h2></p><br />
